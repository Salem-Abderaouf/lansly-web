          is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms and Conditions”). By accessing or using
          any part of the Service, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms
          and Conditions including any future modifications Lansly may amend, update or change these Terms and
          Conditions. If we do this, we will post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and Conditions on
          the Websites for at least 8 days after the changes are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Terms and
          Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions to these Terms and Conditions will become
          effective the earlier of (i) the end of such 8-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service
          after such changes. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions, you are not authorized to use,
          access or participate in the Service</p><br>
        <h3><b>2. </b>Description of Website and Service</h3>

          improvements to or discontinue any aspect of the Service, temporarily or permanently.

        <h4 style="color : #ea3b6c"><b>b. </b>Course Contributor Submissions</h4>
        <p>If you are or become a Course Contributor, you may offer to translate or have translated certain existing
          courses into other languages and you may offer to contribute new courses to the Service, as agreed between you
          and Lansly on a case-by-case basis. Subject to any guidelines posted on the Service, you may perform any such
          translations or create any such courses in accordance with your own schedule and using your own facilities and
          resources. You are not required to become a Course Contributor and you may cease your activities as a Course
          Contributor at any time. You acknowledge that you do not desire and will not receive compensation for your
          activities as a Course Contributor or for our use of any Course Contributor Materials (as defined below) you
          submit. Any translation of an existing Lansly course you submit or have submitted and any new language course
          you submit or have submitted as a Course Contributor (collectively, “Course Contributor Materials”) are owned
          by you (subject of course to us retaining ownership of the existing Lansly course you translated). By
          submitting any Course Contributor Material, you grant us a fully paid up, royalty-free, perpetual,
          sublicensable license to reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivative works of, distribute and
          otherwise use such Course Contributor Material in any manner.
        </p><br>
        <h4 style="color : #ea3b6c"><b>c. </b>General Content</h4>
        <p>As a condition of submitting any ratings, reviews, information, data, text, photographs, audio clips,
          audiovisual works, translations, flashcards or other materials on the Services (“Content”), you hereby grant
          to Lansly a royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, transferable, and sublicensable
          license to use, reproduce, copy, adapt, modify, merge, distribute, publicly display, create derivative works
          from, incorporate such Content into other works; sublicense through multiple tiers the Content, and
          acknowledge that this license cannot be terminated by you once your Content is submitted to the Services. You
          represent that you own or have secured all legal rights necessary for the Content submitted by you to be used
          by you, Lansly, and others as described and otherwise contemplated in these Terms and Conditions. You
          understand that other users will have access to the Content and that neither they or Lansly have any
          obligation to you or anyone else to maintain the confidentiality of the Content.</p><br>
        <h3><b>4. </b>Inappropriate Use</h3>

        <p>You will not upload, display or otherwise provide on or through the Service any content that: (i) is
          libelous, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, hateful, offensive or otherwise violates any law or
          infringes upon the right of any third party (including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other
          personal or proprietary rights); or (ii) in Lansly’s sole judgment, is objectionable or which restricts or
          inhibits any other person from using the Service or which may expose Lansly or its users to any harm or
          liability of any kind.</p><br>
        <h3><b>5. </b>License to Apps</h3>
        <p>Subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions, Lansly grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive
          license to download, install, and use one copy of each App in object code form only on an interactive wireless
          device that you own or control. You may not derive or attempt to derive the source code of all or any portion
          of any App, permit any third party to derive or attempt to derive such source code, or reverse engineer,
          decompile, disassemble, or translate any App or any part thereof. Lansly and its licensors own and shall
          retain all intellectual property rights and other rights in and to the Apps, and any changes, modifications,
          or corrections thereto. The following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using the Apps from
          the Apple App Store. To the extent the other terms and conditions of these Terms and Conditions are less
          restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive
          or conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph apply, but solely with respect to Apps from the Apple
          App Store. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions are solely between you and Lansly, not
          Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the Apps or content thereof. Your use of any App must comply
          with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
          maintenance and support services with respect to the Apps. In the event of any failure of any App to conform
          to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the
          App to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation
          whatsoever with respect to the Apps, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses
          attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms and Conditions.
          You and Lansly acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party
          relating to the Apps or your possession and/or use of any App, including, but not limited to: (i) product
          liability claims; (ii) any claim that an App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
          requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. You and Lansly
          acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that any App or your possession and use of that App
          infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Lansly, not Apple, will be solely responsible for
          the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to
          the extent required by these Terms and Conditions. You must comply with applicable third party terms of
          agreement when using any App. You and Lansly acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are
          third party beneficiaries of these Terms and Conditions as they relate to your license of the Apps, and that,
          upon your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have
          accepted the right) to enforce these Terms and Conditions against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

        <h3><b>6. </b>Third-Party Links, Sites, and Services</h3>
        <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events
          or activities that are not owned or controlled by Lansly. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for
          any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third party
          website, service, or content from Lansly, you understand that these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy
          Policy do not apply to your use of such sites. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Lansly shall not be
          responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising from your use of any third-party

          CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO
          Lansly FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THIS IS AN
          AGGREGATE LIMIT. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.
