    <h1>Why this app</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>
      Developing four skills together in one learning process, receptive skills, reading and listening as well as
      productive skills, writing, and speaking.
      <br><br>
      Using both sides of the brain left and right which guarantee full results.
      <br><br>
      Helping the learner to become fluent by time due to some special strategies that allow the brain to think in the
      target language and overcome the obstacle of translation.
      <br><br>
      The ability to generate new sentences and acquire correct patterns by imitating the writing style of the story
      .at the eighth section expressing the images.
      <br><br>
      Elevating self-confidence and enhancing auto-learning without neediness to an instructor.
      <br><br>
      It is based on <b>"the Natural Approach " </b>which means imitating the same way that the brain follows in
      acquiring his
      mother tongue and focus on understanding messages in the foreign language, and place little or no importance on
      error correction, drilling, or on conscious learning of grammar rules. They also emphasize learning a wide
      vocabulary base over learning new grammatical structures.
      <br><br>
      The process that is mentioned in the app based on the *theory of Noam Chomsky about LAD language acquisition
      device *which speaks about the natural mechanism that the brain follows to generate an infinite number of
      sentences just by providing the brain with correct patterns of sentences
      <br><br>
      The way we put timing to take a break every 25 minutes let you stay focus for a much longer period which may
      reach 10 hours intensively. also, each break you take around 5 to 10 minutes allows your brain to make connections
      between each new information and an old one.
      <br><br>
      In section of drilling on correct pronunciation we give the learner correct tap scripts to listen and attempt to
      imitate them each time he stops and correct his pronunciation. thus he follows the quickest way to pronounce
      correctly regardless of his familiarity with pronunciation rules
      <br><br>
      In the section of expressing images, the learners could acquire immediately the style of writing by imitating
      the way that the writer follows to express the exact meaning through correct patterns of sentences.
      <br><br>
      Providing the learner with the simplest as well as the much little amount of package that allows him to start
      mastering the English language as if you have been learning the language since many years ago.
      <br><br>
      Letting the learner overcome the barriers of translating each sentence to his mother tongue and helping him to
      start thinking with the target language immediately after he finishes the first story. thus he will be ready to
      think like a native speaker.
      <br><br>
      All strategies mentioned in Lansly app are put to train, and motivate the subconscious mind. thus the learning
      process would be highly effective.
